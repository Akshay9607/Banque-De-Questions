# Problem Description

Given two integers left and right that represent the range [left, right], return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

Example 1:

```txt
Input: left = 5, right = 7
Output: 4
```

Example 2:

```txt
Input: left = 0, right = 0
Output: 0
```

Example 3:

```txt
Input: left = 1, right = 2147483647
Output: 0
```

*Constraints:*

0 <= left <= right <= 231 - 1
