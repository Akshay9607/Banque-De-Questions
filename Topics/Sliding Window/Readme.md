# Sliding Window

*Difficulty Level : Easy*

This technique shows how a nested for loop in some problems can be converted to a single for loop to reduce the time complexity.


*Example*

```txt
Given an array of integers of size ‘n’.
Our aim is to calculate the maximum sum of ‘k’ 
consecutive elements in the array.

Input  : arr[] = {1, 4, 2, 10, 23, 3, 1, 0, 20} <br>
k = 4 

Output : 39 <br>
We get maximum sum by adding subarray {4, 2, 10, 23}
of size 4.
```
