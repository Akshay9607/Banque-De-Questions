Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

```txt

```

Example 2:

```txt
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1

```

Example 3:

```txt
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3

```

_Constraints:_

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104 <br>
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces. <br>
