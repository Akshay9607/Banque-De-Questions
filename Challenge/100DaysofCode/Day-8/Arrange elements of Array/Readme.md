# Problem Description

Given an array, the task is to rearrange the elements of the array in such a way that the maximum element of the array is at the beginning, the minimum element is the the 2nd position, the second-max element at the 3rd position, the second-min element at the 4th position and so on.

```py
Example-1

Input:
[1,2,3,4,5,6]

Ouput:
[6,1,5,2,4,3]
```

```py
Example-2

Input:
[10,20,30,40,50,60,70]

Output:
[70,10,60,20,50,30,40]
```

### Expected Space-Time Complexity:

* Time-Complexity: O(nlogn)
* Space-Complexity: O(1)
