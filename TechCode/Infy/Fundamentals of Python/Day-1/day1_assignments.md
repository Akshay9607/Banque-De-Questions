Day -1
-------


1. Write a code to find the minimum among three given
numbers.


2. Write a code to check whether a given number is a
palindrome.


3. Write a code to find the sum of numbers divisible by 4.The
code must allow the user to accept a number and add it to the
sum if it is divisible by 4. It should continue accepting numbers
as long as the user wants to provide an input and should
display the final sum.


4. A three digit number is said to be an “Armstrong number” if
the sum of the third power of its individual digits is equal to
the number itself.Write a program to check whether a number
is armstrong or not.


5. JIT University offering degree courses to students has decided
to provide scholarship based on the following details:

|Branch of study|Score(%)|Scholarship %|Remarks|
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | ------ |
|Arts|Score is at least 90|50|The student is eligible only for one scholarship% even if both the score conditions are valid for the given branch of study. In such cases, students are eligible for the highest scholarship% applicable among the two|
|Arts|Score is an odd number|5|
|Engineering|Score is more than 85|50|
|Engineering|Score is divisible by 7|5|

If there are 500 students who have joined the university, write
a code to calculate and display the final fees to be paid by
each student.
You may accept the branch of study, score and course fee as
inputs for each student and calculate the final fees to be paid
by each student based on formulae given below:
Scholarship amount=course fee * (scholarship%)
Final fee= course fee - scholarship amount

6. The flight ticket rates for a round-trip (Mumbai->Dubai) were as
follows:

● Rate per Adult: Rs. 37550.0

● Rate per Child: 1/3rd of the rate per adult

● Service Tax: 7% of the ticket amount (including all passengers)

● As it was a holiday season, the airline also offered a 10%
discount on the final ticket cost (after inclusion of the service
tax).

● Find and display the total ticket cost for a group which had
adults and children.
