8. A teacher in a school wants to find and display the grade of a student
based on his/her percentage score. The criterion for grades is as given
below:

|Score (both inclusive)|Grade|

|Between 80 and 100|A|
|Between 73 and 79|B|
|Between 65 and 72|C|
|Between 0 and 64|D|
|Any other value|Z|


Assume that the percentage score is a whole number. Write a python
program for the above requirement.


9. Write a python program to find and display the product of three
positive integer values based on the rule mentioned below:

It should display the product of the three values except when one of the
integer value is 7. In that case, 7 should not be included in the product and
the values to its left also should not be included.
If there is only one value to be considered, display that value itself. If no
values can be included in the product, display -1.

Note: Assume that if 7 is one of the positive integer values, then it will occur
only once. Refer the sample I/O given below.


|Sample Input|Expected Output|
| ---------- | ------------- |
|1, 5, 3|15|
|3, 7, 8|8|
|7, 4, 3|12|
1, 5, 7|-1|
